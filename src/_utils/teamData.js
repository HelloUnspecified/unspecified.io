    bio: `I’m a very passionate, entrepreneurial person whose love for developing
    software was born from my obsessive passion for building and customizing
    automobiles. This love of creativity, this love of building, creating,
    lead me to software development. Like the automobile shrunk the world, the
    computer helped people scale. I love the Web. I love Mobile Apps. I love
    IoT and how it’s easier than ever to get a small micro controller to just
    do a thing. Technology is changing the world, and I am glad to be a small
    part of it.`,
